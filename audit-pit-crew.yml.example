# audit-pit-crew.yml
# Project-specific configuration for audit-pit-crew security scanner

scan:
  # Objective B: Defines the root path for all Solidity source files
  # Used by GitManager to filter which files are scanned
  # Relative to repository root
  # Default: "."
  contracts_path: "contracts/"

  # Objective C: List of file/folder glob patterns to completely exclude from scanning
  # Paths can be relative to repository root or contracts_path
  # Default: ["node_modules/**", "test/**"]
  ignore_paths:
    - "node_modules/**"      # NPM dependencies
    - "test/**"              # Test files
    - ".git/**"              # Git metadata
    - "*.pem"                # Private key files
    - "dist/**"              # Build output

  # Objective C: Minimum severity of issues to report in GitHub comments
  # Must be one of: "Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"
  # Issues below this severity level will be filtered out
  # Default: "Low"
  min_severity: "Medium"

  # THE BLOCKER: Minimum severity that causes the PR check to FAIL
  # If any issue is found at or above this severity, the PR will be blocked
  # Must be one of: "Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"
  # This enforces quality gates - PRs with High/Critical issues cannot merge
  # Default: "High"
  block_on_severity: "High"

  # Security analysis tools to run
  # Available tools: slither, mythril, oyente, aderyn
  # Note: Oyente is unmaintained (pip package broken)
  # Note: Aderyn may require specific version - v0.1.9 has a panic bug
  # Default: ["slither", "mythril"] - reliable baseline
  enabled_tools:
    - slither
    - mythril
    # - aderyn  # Uncomment when using aderyn >= v0.3.0
